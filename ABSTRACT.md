The **Land-cOVEr Domain Adaptive semantic segmentation (LoveDA)** dataset was created to provide land-cover semantic segmentation and unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) tasks. Exploring the use of deep transfer learning methods on this dataset will be a meaningful way to promote city-level or national-level land-cover mapping.

The existing high spatial resolution (HSR) land-cover datasets such as the Gaofen Image Dataset (GID) [[38](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425719303414)], DeepGlobe [[9](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2018_workshops/w4/html/Demir_DeepGlobe_2018_A_CVPR_2018_paper.html)], Zeebruges [[24](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924271618300261)], and Zurich Summer [[43](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_workshops_2015/W13/html/Volpi_Semantic_Segmentation_of_2015_CVPR_paper.html)] contain large-scale images with pixel-wise annotations, thus promoting the development of fully convolutional networks (FCNs) in the field of remote sensing [[46](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9123590/), [49](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9530280/)]. However, these datasets are designed only for semantic segmentation, and they ignore the diverse styles among geographic areas. For urban and rural areas, in particular, the manifestation of the land cover is completely different, in the class distributions, object scales, and pixel spectra. In order to improve the model generalizability for large-scale land-cover mapping, appropriate datasets such as LoveDa are required.

The major characteristics of this dataset are summarized as follows:

1) Multi-scale objects. The HSR images were collected from
   18 complex urban and rural scenes, covering three different cities in China. The objects in the same category are in completely different geographical landscapes in the different scenes, which increases the scale variation.
2) Complex background samples. The remote sensing semantic segmentation task is always faced with the complex background samples (i.e., land-cover objects that are not of interest) [[29](), 54], which is particularly the case in the LoveDA dataset. The high-resolution and different complex scenes bring more rich details as well as larger intra-class variance for the background samples.
3) Inconsistent class distributions. The urban and rural scenes have different class distributions. The urban scenes with high population densities contain lots of artificial objects such as buildings and roads. In contrast, the rural scenes include more natural elements, such as forest and water. Compared with UDA datasets [[30](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2019/html/Peng_Moment_Matching_for_Multi-Source_Domain_Adaptation_ICCV_2019_paper.html), [42](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Venkateswara_Deep_Hashing_Network_CVPR_2017_paper.html)] in general computer vision, the LoveDA dataset focuses on the style differences of the geographical environments. The inconsistent class distributions pose a special challenge for the UDA task.
