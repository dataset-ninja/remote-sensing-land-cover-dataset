**LoveDA: A Remote Sensing Land-Cover Dataset for Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation** is a dataset for a semantic segmentation task. It is used in the geoinformational systems (GIS) domain. 

The dataset consists of 5987 images with 20658 labeled objects belonging to 7 different classes including *background*, *road*, *building*, and other: *forest*, *water*, *agriculture*, and *barren*.

Images in the LoveDA dataset have pixel-level semantic segmentation annotations. There are 1796 (30% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *Test* (1796 images), *Train* (2522 images), and *Val* (1669 images). Alternatively, the dataset could be split into 2 areas: <span style="background-color: #ecdefc; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 4px;">rural</span> (2358 images) and <span style="background-color: #ecdefc; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 4px;">urban</span> (1833 images). The dataset was released in 2021 by the Wuhan University, China.

Here are the visualized examples for each of the 7 classes:
